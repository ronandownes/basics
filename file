learning environment that aligns with our core values and goals.


As a student in this school, it is your responsibility to arrive on time for class and attend all classes. While we allow a little flexibility for the first 10 minutes, you should still enter the classroom quietly and without disturbing the class. If you arrive after 10 minutes, please wait until there is a break before entering the classroom.

Using mobile phones during class time is not allowed, as it is disrespectful to the lecturer and other students. Discussions among students should only happen when led by the lecturer, and food should not be consumed in the classroom. Instead, please use the designated area in the basement.

We appreciate your cooperation in following these guidelines for behavior, which align with our core values and goals for creating a positive and respectful learning environment. Thank you.



The pH of Westland citrus potting mix can vary depending on the specific formulation and batch, but typically it ranges between 5.5 to 6.5. This pH range is considered slightly acidic to neutral, which is suitable for most citrus plants.

Citrus plants prefer slightly acidic soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 6.5, as this range allows them to absorb the necessary nutrients from the soil. The Westland citrus potting mix is formulated to provide the ideal growing conditions for citrus plants, including good drainage, aeration, and nutrient availability.

It's important to note that the pH level of the potting mix can change over time as the plant grows and the soil decomposes. Therefore, it's recommended to regularly test the soil pH using a soil pH test kit and adjust the pH level if necessary using pH-adjusting products such as sulfur or lime.


Thank you for the suggestion, Dan. I appreciate your helpful response.
